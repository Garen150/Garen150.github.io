<h1 style="font-size:30px;color:white;text-align:center;">Verse 1</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:25px;color:white;text-align:center;"><pre>
I spit my heart out, lookin' out for my best interests
He gave me good head, peepin' out while the windows tinted
I speak in tongues and I arrive without a damn mention
It's kinda sick, and I was born in 1996 and
1999 the only year that I remember
I slip through the cracks without havin' a damn temper
I bleach my hair because these bitches all about they bitchin'
I say shit when I rap, and y'all niggas barely listen
I do the most for the culture, nigga, by just existing
Delete my tweets 'cause I'm ashamed of being a fuckin' Simpson
I told my mom I was gay, why the fuck she ain't listen?
I signed a pub' deal and her opinion fuckin' disappearin'
I'm payin' bills for my sister and tryna fund a business
Is it homophobic to only hook up with straight niggas?
You know, like, closet niggas, masc-type?
"Why don't you take that mask off?" That's the thought I had last night
"Why you always rap about bein' gay?"
'Cause not enough niggas rap and be gay
Where I come from, niggas get called "faggot" and killed
So I'ma get head from a nigga right here
And they can come and cut my head off, and
And my legs off, and
And I'ma still be a boss 'til my head gone, yeah

Break the wheel, pack the steel, hold my niggas down
Twistin' on that syrup ‘til I hear crackin’ sounds
Break the wheel, pack the steel, hold my niggas down
Twistin' on that syrup ‘til I hear crackin’ sounds
Break, break, break the steel, hold my niggas down
Twistin' on that syrup ‘til I hear crack, crack, crack
Break the wheel, pack the steel, hold my niggas down
Twistin' on that syrup ‘til I hear crack
</pre></h1>
<h1 style="font-size:30px;color:white;text-align:center;">Verse 2</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:25px;color:white;text-align:center;"><pre>
I don't trust nobody 'cause they don't deserve it
Niggas run in your house, they know you doin' dirty
(Go 'head, now)
I got my hand on an ounce, and I got money servin'
I just bought me a fifth and now I'm speedin', swervin'
(Go 'head, now)
I took an eighth of them shrooms, and now I'm hearin' voices
I took like two of them pills, I can't remember nothing
(Go 'head, now)
I ain't under control, I'm losin' motor function
I need an intervention, I need an exorcism
I need a therapist, paranoia and drug addiction
It's very scary, my momma don't even recognize me
I'm goin' crazy, don't need nobody to say they love me
My acts of desperation, I'm on an empty stomach
So fuck the consequences, I ain't runnin' from them
</pre></h1>
<h1 style="font-size:30px;color:white;text-align:center;">Verse 3</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:25px;color:white;text-align:center;"><pre>
Feelin' like a goner, put my life in locker
Hotbox in the Hummer
Hot bars in the summer (Merlyn, Merlyn!)
If I had the option, I would do it all again
If I had the option, I would do it all again
I just wanna feel like I did the right program
I just want to appeal to my dad and my cousins (Again)
When I cut the veal, I do not think 'bout diplomas
Love is knowin' that you didn’t do it by your lonesome
So I forgive my mommy, daddy, auntie, and my uncles
For guilt-tripping feelings whenever they call my number
They see men dream, they see men fallin'
But when I dream, I'm smashing on a Lana

Both pessimistic, drug addicted, caught in our feelings
We spit venom then stare at the ceiling, wondering, "why?"
My mom's no alcoholic, she just wanna drown her sorrows
Love her to death and soon enough, I'll give back all I borrowed
Both so submissive, take turns dominating, the light has been faded
This hate-fueled love, we don't fake it, no givin', just takin'
</pre></h1>
<h1 style="font-size:30px;color:white;text-align:center;">Verse 4</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:21px;color:white;text-align:center;">I took some steps to be a bigger person</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:21px;color:red;text-align:center;">I should've thrown ya off the highway, the cars swerving</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:21px;color:white;text-align:center;">Ain't no burden, ain't no sermon, ain't no motherfuckin' plaque</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:21px;color:white;text-align:center;">I hate these hospitals and police and the smell of death—all that</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:21px;color:white;text-align:center;">I hate these shady folk that want it ladylike</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:21px;color:white;text-align:center;">But don't treat lady right, but they be sayin', like ("Just the tip!")</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:21px;color:red;text-align:center;"><a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/two-women-detail-abuse-allegations-against-ex-brockhampton-member-ameer-vann/">And yeah, you mad 'cause she ain't fuck, mad 'cause she ain't suck</a></h1>
<h1 style="font-size:21px;color:white;text-align:center;">Beat your ass before you got time to say "Why not?"</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:21px;color:white;text-align:center;">Here to catch you slip up, wish you could just rewind</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:21px;color:white;text-align:center;">Time and not fuck up, thought you had just lucked up</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:21px;color:red;text-align:center;">Where the respect? Is your ass human?</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:21px;color:red;text-align:center;">I look you in your eyes, say, "Fuck you, are you fuckin' stupid?"</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:21px;color:white;text-align:center;">Respect my mother, 'spect my sister, 'spect these women, boy</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:21px;color:white;text-align:center;">I get my 9-9, I don't own one, hit the store to blow your brains off</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:21px;color:white;text-align:center;">Better hope my aim off, better hope the range off</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:21px;color:white;text-align:center;">Better hope my tame off before I blow your brains off, boy</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:30px;color:white;text-align:center;">Outro</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:25px;color:white;text-align:center;"><pre>
Ugh, no hands with the stunts
Jump off the roof like I do what I want
All of my life in my past wanna haunt
And my sight of the future beginning to taunt my ambition
Man on the moon, I'm marooned, I ain't trippin', I'm on a mission
Every time that I speak, they ain't skippin'
Turned my inspiration to a vision, that's a given, no slippin'

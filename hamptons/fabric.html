<h1 style="font-size:30px;color:white;text-align:center;">Verse 1</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:21px;color:#39417d;text-align:center;">I can't sleep like I used to</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:25px;color:white;text-align:center;"><pre>
The world will try to tell you who you are before you get to
Explain yourself, your thoughts
Your motives and all of your reasons
Two albums every season, what the hell do y’all believe in?
Why the hell do y'all keep reachin'?
In the evenings when I see ’em
I tell myself that love will be the thing to keep us from grieving
Need something new to believe in
'Cause these new niggas'll change on you
I mean they change on you
Why the hell the BBC only writes about me
When it comes down to controversy?
What about three CD's in one year with no label?
Then we signed and our story turned into a fucking fable
I was that nigga in a room with no motherfuckin' cable and no table
Now my mom call me whenever she need her car note
Cellphone, whatever bill paid too, y'all niggas losers
You don't understand why I do what I do, so let me do it
Get the hell on, let me do it, get the hell on, let me do it
</pre></h1>
<h1 style="font-size:30px;color:white;text-align:center;">Verse 2</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:21px;color:white;text-align:center;">I don't speak like I used to</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:21px;color:white;text-align:center;">I’m thinking of a way to change the world that I move through</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:21px;color:white;text-align:center;">I feel like Nikola, what I invent is what I’m true to</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:21px;color:white;text-align:center;">I feel for Nikola with these ideas that I grew through</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:21px;color:white;text-align:center;">I know that when they see a brilliant mind they'll just abuse you</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:21px;color:#39417d;text-align:center;">It’s hard to feel what's real, some nights I'm scared that I'm delusional</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:21px;color:white;text-align:center;">I’m scared I'm more like Nikola than I'd ever collude to</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:21px;color:white;text-align:center;">I'm scared of what can happen when ideas will consume you</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:21px;color:white;text-align:center;">'Cause there isn't room for peace I can achieve</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:21px;color:white;text-align:center;"></h1>
<h1 style="font-size:30px;color:white;text-align:center;">Chorus</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:25px;color:white;text-align:center;"><pre>
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
I keep tellin' ya
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
</pre></h1>
<h1 style="font-size:30px;color:white;text-align:center;">Bridge</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:25px;color:white;text-align:center;"><pre>
Stay rough, get buff, get out, hey, boy
Stay rough, get buff, get out
The monsters swarm 'round with them toys
The monsters swarm 'round with them toys
Hey, boy, stay rough, get buff, get out
Hey, boy, stay rough, get buff, get out
The monsters swarm 'round with them toys
The monsters swarm 'round with them toys
</pre></h1>
<h1 style="font-size:30px;color:white;text-align:center;">Verse 3</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:25px;color:white;text-align:center;"><pre>
Don't mind me, I'm just killin' time (You can pick me to pieces)
But if you've got a lifeline, throw it, throw it
Don't mind me, I'm just killin' time (You can pick me to pieces)
But if you've got a lifeline, throw it, throw it
</pre></h1>
<h1 style="font-size:30px;color:white;text-align:center;">Verse 4</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:21px;color:white;text-align:center;">Why the fuck would you share this shit with these people?</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:21px;color:#39417d;text-align:center;">I don't know these people, I don't know you either, no more</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:21px;color:#39417d;text-align:center;">I'm at war with myself</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:21px;color:white;text-align:center;">Every time I see this shit I wanna kill myself</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:21px;color:white;text-align:center;">And they coming for my mother, sending bullets for my head</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:21px;color:white;text-align:center;">Think they fallin' in love but I'd rather be dead</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:21px;color:#39417d;text-align:center;"><a href ="depress.jpg">Please just leave me alone, I don't wanna be read</a></h1>
<h1 style="font-size:21px;color:white;text-align:center;">Yeah, yeah</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:21px;color:white;text-align:center;"></h1>
<h1 style="font-size:30px;color:white;text-align:center;">Chorus</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:25px;color:white;text-align:center;"><pre>
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
I keep tellin' ya
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
I keep tellin' ya
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
I keep tellin' ya
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
I keep tellin' ya
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
</pre></h1>
<h1 style="font-size:30px;color:white;text-align:center;">Outro</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:25px;color:white;text-align:center;"><pre>
It's the best years of our lives, motherfucker
You are now about to experience
These are the best years of our lives
I feel you
